# 2. Differentiate between paint and repaint method.

### paint() vs repaint()

-  paint() method is the method of the AWT/Swing component class that is `called by the system` to render the component on the screen whereas repaint() method is the method of the AWT/Swing component class that is used to `request the system to call the paint()` method.

- The paint() method is `automatically invoked by the system` when a component needs to be rendered whereas the repaint() method is `manually invoked by the programmer` when a component needs to be scheduled for repainting.

- The paint() method is `less efficient` since it requires more processing power whereas the repaint() method is `more efficient` since it only update the areas that have changed.

- The paint() method is `not generally recommended` to use in the java GUI programming whereas the repaint() method is `recommended` to use in the modern Java GUI programming.

- The paint() method can be `overriden by the programmer` to customize the way a component is painted whereas the repaint() method is `predefined that cannot be customized`.

- The paint() method can cause the `flickering` whereas the repaint() methods `avoids the flickering`.
